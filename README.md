# Hierarchical-Clustering-in-R
Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.In data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.Agglomerative clustering: It's also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting). It works in a bottom-up manner. ... Divisive hierarchical clustering: It's also known as DIANA (Divise Analysis) and it works in a top-down manner.
